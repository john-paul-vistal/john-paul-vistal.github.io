          <P class="ml-4">Graphic designers combine art and technology to communicate ideas through images and the
            layout of websites and printed pages. They may use a variety of design elements to achieve artistic or
            decorative effects.</P>

          <p class="ml-4">Graphic designers work with both text and images. They often select the type, font, size,
            color, and line
            length of headlines, headings, and text. Graphic designers also decide how images and text will go together
            on a print or webpage, including how much space each will have. When using text in layouts, graphic
            designers collaborate closely with writers who choose the words and decide whether the words will be put
            into paragraphs, lists, or tables. Through the use of images, text, and color, graphic designers can
            transform statistical data into visual graphics and diagrams, which can make complex ideas more accessible.</p>

          <p class="ml-4">Graphic design is important in the sales and marketing of products, and is a critical
            component of
            brochures and logos. Therefore, graphic designers, also referred to as graphic artists or communication
            designers, often work closely with people in advertising and promotions, public relations, and marketing.</p>

          <p class="ml-4">Frequently, designers specialize in a particular category or type of client. For example,
            some create the
            graphics used in packaging for various types of retail products, while others may work on the visual design
            used on a book jacket.</p>

          <P class="ml-4">Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) is the application of computer graphics to create or
            contribute to images in art, printed media, video games, films, television programs, shorts, commercials,
            videos, and simulators.</P>

          <p class="ml-4">CGI is used for visual effects because the quality is often higher and effects are more
            controllable than other more physically based processes, such as constructing miniatures for effects shots
            or hiring extras for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible
            using any other technology.</p>

          <p class="ml-4">Computer Generated Imagery helps in visualizing technical concepts that would be difficult to
            illustrate in any other way.
            This gives clients the opportunity to visualize living in that particular home. It is also a useful way to
            create very high quality photo-realistic illustration.
            Architectural visualizations give a professional, sharp and artistic edge to any real estate commercial
            presentation.
            Then, it is inexpensive and allows a single artist to produce content without the hiring of extras for
            crowd scenes, expensive set pieces or props.
            Computer Generated Imagery’s visual effects are more controllable than other more physically
            based processes such as constructing miniatures for effect shots because it allows the creation of images
            that would not be feasible using any other technology.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, unlike hand-drawn animations, Computer Generated Imagery is time efficient and believable.</p>

          <P class="ml-4">Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers.

            It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation.

            Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely
            used for low bandwidth and faster real-time rendering needs.

            Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but it sometimes the target is another
            medium, such as film.

            It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when
            used in films.</P>

          <p class="ml-4">To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer screen then quickly
            replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly.

            This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion
            pictures.

            Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the art of stop motion animation of 3D models and
            frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations.

            For 3D animations, objects (models) are built on the computer monitor (modeled) and 3D figures are rigged
            with a virtual skeleton.

            For 2D figure animations, separate objects (illustrations) and separate transparent layers are used, with
            or without a virtual skeleton.</p>

          <P class="ml-4">Digital printing means to methods of printing from a digital-based image directly to a
            variety of media. It usually refers to professional printing where small-run jobs from desktop publishing
            and other digital sources are printed using large-format and/or high-volume laser or inkjet printers.</P>

          <p class="ml-4">The 3D printing technology made its way to the technological world in the year 1986, but not
            gain importance until 1990. It was not that popular outside the world of engineering, architecture and
            manufacturing.

            3D printing is also known as desktop fabrication, it can form any material that can be obtained as a
            powder. For creating an object you need a digital 3D-model. You can scan a set of 3D images, or draw it
            using computer-assisted design or CAD software. You can also download them from internet. The digital
            3D-model is usually saved in STL format and then sent to the printer. The process of "printing" a
            three-dimensional object layer-by-layer with equipment, which is quite similar with ink-jet printers.</p>

          <p class="ml-4">A laser printer is a popular type of personal computer printer that uses a non-impact (keys
            don't strike
            the paper), photocopier technology. When a document is sent to the printer, a laser beam "draws" the
            document on a selenium-coated drum using electrical charges. After the drum is charged, it is rolled in
            toner, a dry powder type of ink.</p>
